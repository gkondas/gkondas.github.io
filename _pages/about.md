About Me
===

Hello! Iâ€™m a PhD student at [Columbia DBMI](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/), currently rotating with Professor [Matthew McDermott](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/profile/matthew-mcdermott/). My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and health. Here is my [CV](https://gkondas.github.io/files/gregCV.pdf).

Before Columbia, I earned a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Physics from the University of Michigan. At the Michigan AI Lab with Professor [Jenna Wiens](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wiensj/), I worked on machine learning for healthcare, first as an undergraduate researcher, then for a year as a pre-doctoral researcher.

Outside of research I enjoy cycling, keeping up with the news, music, and cooking!

Sarah Jabbour, **Gregory Kondas**, Ella Kazerooni, Michael W. Sjoding, David Fouhey\*, Jenna Wiens\*. *ECCV 2024*. [\[paper\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14509)[\[code\]](https://github.com/MLD3/DEPICT)

Permutation importance has been used to provide feature importance explanations for tabular-based models. Leveraging text-conditioned diffusion, we extend this framework to image-based models and facilitate dataset-level model explanations.
