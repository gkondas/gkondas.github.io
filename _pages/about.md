About Me
===

Hello! Iâ€™m an incoming PhD student in AI/ML at [Columbia DBMI](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/), where I'll be focusing on machine learning for healthcare. Here is my [CV](https://gkondas.github.io/files/gregCV.pdf).

I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Physics (Go Blue!). During my time at Michigan, I worked with Professor [Jenna Wiens](https://websites.umich.edu/~wiensj/) both as an undergraduate and a pre-doctoral researcher.

Outside of research I enjoy cycling, keeping up with current events, music, and cooking!

Permutation importance has been used to provide feature importance explanations for tabular-based models. Leveraging text-conditioned diffusion, we extend this framework to image-based models and facilitate dataset-level model explanations.
