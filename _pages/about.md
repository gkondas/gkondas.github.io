About Me
===

Hello! I am a full time research assistant at the Michigan AI lab working with Professor [Jenna Wiens](https://websites.umich.edu/~wiensj/). I am fortunate to have [Sarah Jabbour](https://sjabbour.github.io/) as an awesome mentor! My research focuses on **machine learning with applications in healthcare.** I am currently interested in **foundation models for healthcare** , 
**medical time series analysis**, and **explainable AI**. I will soon be applying to Ph.D. programs with start dates in the fall of 2025. Here is my [CV](https://gkondas.github.io/files/gregCV.pdf).

I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Physics (Go Blue!). I also completed ample coursework in the life sciences. In the past, my broad interest in science led me to a variety of research fields. I worked on problems in computational neuroscience with Professor [Thad Polk](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/tpolk.html). I also spent a summer optimizing the construction and testing of components for CERNâ€™s upgraded [muon spectrometer](https://atlas.cern/Discover/Detector/Muon-Spectrometer) under the direction of Professor [Bing Zhou](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics/people/faculty/bzhou.html).

Outside of research I enjoy basketball, keeping up with current events, music, and cooking!

**DEPICT: Diffusion Enabled Permutation Impotance for Image Classification Tasks**  
Sarah Jabbour, **Gregory Kondas**, Ella Kazerooni, Michael W. Sjoding, David Fouhey\*, Jenna Wiens\*. *ECCV 2024*. [\[paper\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14509)[\[code\]](https://github.com/MLD3/DEPICT)

Permutation importance has been used to provide feature importance explanations for tabular-based models. Leveraging text-conditioned diffusion, we extend this framework to image-based models and facilitate dataset-level model explanations.
